State Management: Implemented using the Provider package to manage the country list and search functionality efficiently.

List Filtering: The search field filters country names dynamically based on user input.

UI Enhancements: Used containers with styled borders and colors to improve the UI.

Async Programming: Implemented future API call functionality for potential scalability.
